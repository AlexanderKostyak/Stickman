# Stickman
A simple desktop PC Game About a stickman and a vertical challenge

This simple game is incomplete but currently playable in the XOJO development enviroment.  XOJO (formerly RealBasic) is a great platform for rapid cross-platform application development and front-end GUI simplification, with great syntax correction.  I am a fan of the language.

The game was intended to include a timer and time-driven functions (as opposed to refresh-driven), and use color values to deduce obstacles, checkpoints, and death zones.  The reasoning would incorporate custom level development, so that a basic user could create challenges in Microsoft paint or their favorite photo editor.

If you stand for too long, you will start to dribble your head.
